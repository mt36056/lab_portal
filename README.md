Student Monitoring System

The objective of the application is to allow lab administrator to monitor student/students. The application involves students to sign up during their first lab and then logging in all the following labs. The following information can be displayed on the server side when the student/students are logged in:<br>
->Active users in the lab<br>
->Check whether the students have connected or disconnected any peripheral devices<br>
->Information about previous sessions in the lab<br>
->Shutting down PCs as and when required<br>

<h4>The proposed software can be applied to labs for the following purposes:</h4><br>
->Entry of students present in lab in the college database<br>
->Viewing the database of students present in previous lab<br>
<br>->Viewing the peripheral devices connected by an active user(if they have connected or disconnected any peripheral device) 
<br>->Shutting down a particular or all student’s pc for their anonymous behaviour

<h4>CONCLUSION</h4><br>
The Lab portal application allows administrator to monitor each and every student in the lab. The users are not allowed to close the application and if such a case happens, then that particular PC is shut down. The objective of this project is to provide a portal that facilitates the lab administrator	 to keep a check on each user without actually going to each and every user. The project is implemented using the concepts of JAVA, DBMS and NETWORKING. 
On client side, the basic details of student who is currently logged in is displayed with a digital clock. On the server’s end, the following functions are provided to the administrator:
<br>->Show details of active users
<br>->Show details of devices connected
<br>->Shut down PCs<br>
->Show database of previously active users
<br>->Change password of a student or administrator’s password
<br>->Clear all the database

<h4>FUTURE WORKS</h4><br>
The following modules can be appended in the project:
<br>->Allowing teachers to analyse attendance of students and also providing attendance details to students to keep a check on their attendance 
<br>->E-library can be very easily implemented using this application
<br>->Internet labs can be administered and a database of website visited can be maintained
